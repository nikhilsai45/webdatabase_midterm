            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne;[4] German: [ˈalbɛɐt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] ⓘ; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,[5] widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time.
                Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century.
                His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation".[7] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",[8] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.
                In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time.[11] His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word Einstein broadly synonymous with genius.</p>
                <p>In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.[13] These outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity—a theory which addressed the inability 
                    of classical mechanics to account satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic field—and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, 
                    mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole.
                    The middle part of his career also saw him making important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons.</p>
                <p>For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that proved ultimately unsuccessful. Firstly, he fought a long rearguard action against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental 
                    randomness into science's picture of the world, objecting that "God does not play dice".[16] Secondly, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to 
                    include electromagnetism too. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.

                <h3>Early Life</h5>
                <p> 
                    Albert Einstein Born on March 14, 1879, in the southern German city of Ulm, Albert Einstein grew up in a middle-class Jewish family in Munich.
                    Einstein became fascinated by music, mathematics and science.In 1896, he renounced his German citizenship, and remained officially stateless before becoming a Swiss citizen in 1901.

                <h3>Findings</h5>
                <p>
                    Graduation, Einstein struggled to find work as a scientist. He took a job as a patent 
                    clerk in Bern, Switzerland, where he worked for several years. During this time, he continued 
                    to work on physics problems in his spare time. In 1905, Einstein published several papers that revolutionized physics. These papers included 
                    his theory of special relativity, which showed that time and space were not absolute, but relative 
                    to the observer.He also proposed that energy and mass were equivalent (E=mc^2), a concept that 
                    would later lead to the development of nuclear energy.

                <h3>Later life</h5>
                <p>
                    In the late 1930s, Einstein’s theories, including his equation E=mc^2, helped form the basis of the development of the atomic bomb. 
                        In 1939, at the urging of the Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard, Einstein wrote to President Franklin 
                        D. Roosevelt advising him to approve funding for the development of uranium before Germany could gain the upper hand.
                        Throughout the last years of his life, Einstein continued his quest for a unified field theory. 
                        Though he published an article on the theory in Scientific American in 1950, it remained unfinished when he died, of an aortic aneurysm, five years later.
